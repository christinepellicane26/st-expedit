    <h1>Get to know St. Expedit</h1> 
    </p>


     <h2>Patron saint for expedited help, and protection during travel</h2>
    <img src="st expedit 040317.jpg" alt = "st expedit" class="responsive">
    
 

    <div>
   
      <p class = "special">St. Expedit is the patron saint of urgent requests that need immediate resolution. 
      Shrines dedicated to his likeness can be found tucked away along the roadsides of 
      Reunion Island, off the coast of Madagascar.</p>

    </div>

 
  <h3>Who Was He?</h3>

  <div id="areaA">

  <p>Legend has it that nuns who first settled on Reunion Island requested some religious 
    statuary from the Vatican. Boxes arrived marked "Expedit" (rush) and the Roman 
    soldier statues contained within were thought to be the likeness of a saint named 
    Expedit.
  </p>

  <p>    
    The story associated with this saint is one of a Roman soldier who wanted to become
    a Christian. The devil appeared to him as a crow saying, "Tomorrow! Tomorrow!"
    (the Latin word for tomorrow is <i>cras,</i> which also happens to be the sound that a crow makes.) 
    <br></br>
    He subdued the crow underfoot, declaring, "I will be a Christian <i>today!</i>" He was executed for 
    his beliefs soon after, forever exemplifying the need to avoid procrastination.  
  </p>

    </div>


  <h3>Symbolism</h3>

  <div id="areaB">

  <img src="crow on fence jackson.jfif" alt="crow" class="responsive">

  <p>
    St. Expedit is normally depicted cradling a palm frond, with a crow underfoot,
    and a cross in hand. The cross has "Hodie" (Latin for "today") written across it. 
    </p>
    
  <p>
    Apparently, there were also images of St. Expedit holding a clock instead of a cross, as a reminder 
    that time is of the essence. This is the Expedit depicted here:  Instead of a cross, he his holding a cog, to symbolize both smooth travel (like on a bicycle) and the passage 
    of time (as found inside a traditional clock or watch.)
  </p>

        <div id="areaB">

          <p>The palm frond he cradles symbolizes martyrdom. 
            <br>
            In this depiction, the palm is paired with a water bottle, essential to those traveling under their 
            own power, as Roman soldiers often did. 
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>His helmet symbolizes protection, especially important for cyclists. April 16th is his feast day,
              and red and gold are the colors most often associated with him. He was martyred in CE303, beheaded
              during the Diocletian persecution.
            </p>

          </p>

        <br></br>
        

       <div id="areaC">
        <br>
        <p>
        While he has earned a reputation for very quick resolutions to problems, this incarnation of him 
        also focuses on protection during travel (especially for journeys under one's own power). 
        </p>

       </div>
       <br>
       <br>

       <div id="areaD">

       <img src="La_RÃ©union_Ravine_St_Expedit.jpg" alt="ravine shrine" class="responsive" id="img2" img size= 50%>
                  
        <p>His shrines are painted red and hidden away, usually in neutral territory, such as roadsides. They are 
          often decorated with flowers, votive candles, and other statues, along with tokens of gratitude left by
          devotees.        
        
        <p>He accepts gold-colored tokens of appreciation (bright copper pennies are close enough!) which 
        symbolize the payment Roman soldiers would normally receive. </p>

        <img src="offerings.jpg" alt="gold coin offerings" class="responsive" id="img3">

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
       
        
        <p>Because the soldiers traveled under their own power, very often walking long distances, St. Expedit 
          accepts gold-colored food as well, pound cake being the usual offering.
        </p> 


        </div>

        <br>
        <br>

        <div id="areaD">
        
        <p>Sometimes, people will behead the statues in an effort to break a curse, or in anger for a request 
        not met. However, St. Expedit is a benign entity, and is not to be petitioned for malicious purposes. 
        
        <br>
        <br> 
        Curses cannot be inflicted in his name; his purpose is to serve and protect.
        
      </p> 
      
      <img src="statue_of_StExpeditus.jpg" alt="hodie cross" class="responsive" id="img3">
        
        <p>Those who have paid their respects to this incarnation of St. Expedit have been pleasantly surprised by 
        how quickly and expeditiously their requests have been granted, and how efficient their traveling has been. 
        </p> 

        <p>
          Because he is not officially recognized by the Catholic church, and is not openly invoked by Christians 
          who don't recognize intercessory saints, people tend to visit his shrines secretly, and petition him privately.
          </p>

        </div>
      
        <p>This is my personal tribute to the saint, whom I first learned about during a trip to Reunion Island 
        several years ago. This is why I use the anglicized-French spelling of the name.</p>  
        
        <p>Thank you for your patience as the website gets up and running!</p>
