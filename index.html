        <p class = "special">St. Expedit is the patron saint of urgent requests that need a quick resolution. 
        Shrines dedicated to his likeness can be found tucked away along the roadsides of 
        Reunion Island, where he is also asked for protection during travel.</p>
        
        <p>Legend has it that nuns who first settled on the island requested some religious 
        statuary from the Vatican. Boxes arrived marked "Expedit" (rush) and the Roman 
        soldier statues contained within were thought to be the likeness of a saint named 
        Expedit.</p> 
        
        <p>The story associated with this saint is one of a Roman soldier who wanted to become
        a Christian. The devil appeared to him as a crow saying, "Tomorrow! Tomorrow!"
        (the Latin word for tomorrow is <i>cras,</i>the sound that a crow makes.) He subdued the 
        crow declaring, "I will be a Christian <i>today!</i>" He died soon after,
        forever exemplifying the need to stop procrastinating.</p> 

        <p>This is why he is depicted with a crow underfoot, and a cross in hand. The palm frond 
        symbolizes martyrdom, and the cross has "Hodie" (Latin for "today") written on it. 
        Apparently, there were also images of St. Expedit holding a clock instead of a cross. This is 
        the Expedit depicted here, as he is not officially recognized by the Catholic church, 
        and is not openly invoked by Christians (hence the reason so many Christians tend to visit 
        his shrines in secret, and thank him privately.) </p>
        
        <p>While he has become the "go-to" saint for nearly all requests, this incarnation of him 
        focuses on the need for very fast resolutions to problems, and protection during travel. 
        Instead of a cross, he his holding a cog, to symbolize both smooth travel and the passage 
        of time (as inside a clock.)</p>
        
        <p>The palm frond is paired with a water bottle, important for sustaining the well-being of 
        travelers, especially those traveling under their own power, as Roman soldiers often did.
        His helmet symbolizes protection, especially important for cyclists.</p> 
        
        <p>His shrines are painted red and hidden away, usually in neutral territory, such as roadsides.</p> 
        
        <p>He accepts gold-colored tokens of appreciation (bright copper pennies are close enough!) which 
        symbolize the payment Roman soldiers would normally receive. Because the soldiers traveled 
        under their own power, very often walking long distances, St. Expedit accepts gold-colored food 
        as well, pound cake being the usual offering.</p> 
        
        <p>Sometimes, people will behead the statues in an effort to break a curse, or in anger for a request 
        not met. However, St. Expedit is a benign entity, and is not to be petitioned for malicious purposes. 
        Curses are not to be inflicted in his name; his purpose is to serve and protect.</p>  
        
        <p>Those who have paid their respects to this incarnation of St. Expedit have been pleasantly surprised by 
        how quickly and expeditiously their requests have been granted, and how efficient their traveling has been. 
        </p> 
        
        <p>This is my personal tribute to the saint, whom I first learned about during a trip to Reunion Island 
        several years ago. This is why I use the anglicized-French spelling of the name.</p>
